# Say hello to Tab.

It's the most advanced tab software on the planet.

# Project Status

I hacked this together in a week for a debate tournament. It should probably be rewritten as a web app at some point.

# Sarcastic Marketing Feature List

## Innovative user interface
The best user interface is no user interface. That's why Tab features a beautiful, command driven interface. It saves you from having to use your mouse because there are no buttons you can click on.

## Amazing update alert system
Tab gets better all the time, and we want you to have the latest version. That's why Tab will tell you if there's an update available. Isn't that great? **UPDATE**: The update alert system has been discontinued. Bad pun totally intended.

## Automatic auto-save
Losing your work is a thing of the past with Automatic Auto-Save. If Tab crashes, it's your fault, but you can get back to where you were quickly and easily with Auto-Save.

## Really robust data import
Use your favorite spreadsheet application to manage your list of teams, judges, and rooms. Tab can import that data and will absolutely never, ever crash. Really.

## Runs on any computer
Using a PC? Got a Mac? Who cares! Tab runs on any computer. Just make sure you have Java installed.

## Advanced pairing
Tab uses adaptive weighting, quality index verification, and iterative simulations to balance pairing factors and create high-quality pairings. You probably don't even know what those words mean.

## Groundbreaking break determiner
When it's time to start elimination rounds, Tab performs a recursive graph search to break teams via head-to-head. It's simply stunning.

## Free and open source
Given all those amazing features, how much does Tab cost? Zero. That's right. While other tab software companies charge you hundreds of dollars per tournament, you can snag this top-notch app for free. What a steal!
